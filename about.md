<p>Call me X<sup>[1]</sup> (where X can be any name, for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael_%28Moby-Dick%29">Ishmael</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick">Moby-dick</a> fame). I enjoy Mathematics (in the purest form) and am forced to learned some&nbsp; Computer-Science and Applied-Mathematics. So, in this blog, it is reasonable to expect things that encompass around the one&rsquo;s I enjoy and the one&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m being forced.</p>
<p>I usually post about things that I&rsquo;m currently learning. The link <a href="http://blog1729.github.io/archive">archives</a> displays all my posts so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1729 Trivia</strong><sup>[2]</sup></p>
<p>$1729 = 12^3 +1 = 10^3+7^3$.</p>
<p>For more trivia on the number, see <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hardy-RamanujanNumber.html">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_%28number%29">this</a>.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to render Mathematics, <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a> to share code, <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?">Google-Analytics</a> to analyze traffic and <a href="https://disqus.com/home/forum/blog1729/">Disqus</a> for comments. I will continue using these till I find a better alternative<sup>[3]</sup>.

<p><small><sup>[1]</sup> In other words, I want to remain <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=anonymous&amp;ia=definition">anonymous</a>. Also, how often are you going to see a writing that starts with &ldquo;Call me&rdquo;?</small></p>
<p><small><sup>[2]</sup> I have no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Number_23">obsession with the number</a> 1729, it is just that every normal blog-names are already taken.)</small></p>
<p><small><sup>[3]</sup> I do not think there could be a better alternative to MathJax, Analytics or Gist and am totally satisfied with them. I&rsquo;m told that the current version of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18146068/is-it-possible-to-use-mathjax-in-disqus/18158057#18158057">Disqus does not support MathJax in comments</a> and was unable to install an <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">alternative comment platform that supports MathJax.</a></small></p>
