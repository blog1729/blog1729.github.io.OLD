* **Getting help**: Use `?blah` if `blah` exists, `??blah` to search if `blah` exists, `help.search("blah")` can be also used.
* R syntax is very similar to C. In R for global assignment use `<<-`, e.g., `x <<- 1` will make the value of global variable `x` as 1, whereas if `x <- 1` makes a local variable `x` whose value will be 1. x

Some useful R functions

|`runif`| For generating uniform random variable |
| `cat`| For formatting output |
| `sqrt` | Square root |
| `hist` | Histogram, e.g., `hist(xs, breaks = 10, main = "LCG", col = "grey")`|
| `plot` | Plotting $xy$, e.g., `plot(xs, ys, cex = 0.1, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y")`|
| `rpois` | Poisson random variable |
| `exp` | Exponential function |
| `log` | Logarithmic function |
