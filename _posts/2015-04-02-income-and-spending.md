- **Agreegate demand** is the total amount of goods demanded in the economy. One can write aggregate demand as $AD = C+I+G+NX$, where $C$ is consumption, $I$ is investment, $G$ is government spending and $NX$ is net exports.
- At equilibrium level, the quantity of output produces is equal to the aggregate demand, i.e., $Y=AD$.
- When aggregate demand---the amount people want to buy---is not equal to the output, there is *unplanned inventory investment* or dis-investment. We call $IU = Y-AD$ is the unplanned additions to the inventory. Clearly, if output is greater than aggregate demand the value of $IU$ is greater than zero and vice-versa. If excess inventories accumulates, the firms cuts down on production until the aggregate demand and output is equal.

## Consumption function and Aggregate demand

- The relationship between *consumption and income* is described by **consumption function**.
- We assume that the consumption demand increases with the level of income and hence the equation $C=\bar{C} + cY$, $\bar{C}>0$ and $0<c<1$. 
- The variable $\bar{C}$ is the intercept and $c$ is the slope. The remaining fraction, i.e., $1-c$ is saved.
- The coefficient $c$ is called **marginal propensity to consume** and $1-c$ is called **marginal propensity to save**. 

## Consumption, aggregate demand, and autonomous spending

- We assume that investment is $\bar{I}$, government spending is $\bar{G}$, taxes are $\bar{TA}$, transfers are $\bar{TR}$, and net exports are $\bar{NX}$. The *consumption now depends upon disposable income*. Thus

$$ \begin{align}
YD & = Y - TA + TR \\
C & = \bar{C} + cYD = \bar{C}+c(Y+TR-TA)
\end{align}$$

- Aggregate demand is the sum of consumption function $C$, Investment, government spending and net exports.

$$ \begin{align}
AD & = C+ I + G + NX \\
&= [\bar{C}-c(\bar{TA}-\bar{TR}) + \bar{I} + \bar{G} + \bar{NX}] + cY \\
&= \bar{A}+cY
\end{align}$$

- Here $\bar{A}$ is independent of the level of income, i.e., autonomous. We also refer this as *autonomous spending*. (*Note:* here $I$ does not represent income, rather, it is investment.)

## Formula for equilibrium condition

### Equilibrium output
- At equilibrium, *the output is equal to the aggregate demand*, i.e.,  $Y= AD$ and we denote the value of $Y$ at equilibrium as $Y_0$. One can easily show that $Y_0 = \frac{1}{1-c} \bar{A}$, where $c$ is the marginal propensity to consume. 
- *We see that the equilibrium level of output is higher, when the marginal propensity to consume is higher and also when the autonomous spending is higher.*
- The book says that the change in autonomous spending and the change in output can be equated by the following relation $\Delta Y = \frac{1}{1-c} \Delta{\bar{A}}$. 

### Saving and Investment

* When there is *no government* and *no foreign trade*, *in equilibrium, planned investment is equal to savings*.
* The above statement can also be phrased in the following way, when there is no government or foreign investment, income is either spent or saved, $Y = C + S$. Also the aggregate demand is equal to Consumption plus Investment, $Y = C + I$, which implies that $I = S$.

* If we include government and foreign trade, then income can either be saved, spent or used to pay taxes and hence $Y = C + S + TA - TR$ and complete aggregate demand is $Y = C + I + G + NX$ (the National Income accounting). Thus, we see that:

$$\begin{align}
C + I + G + NX & = C + S + TA - TR \\
I & = S + (TA-TR-G) + NX \\
\end{align}$$

* The term $(TA-TR-G)$ is called budget surplus and it's negative is called budget deficit. 


## Multiplier

* One can show that the equilibrium output changes when the autonomous aggregate demand increases by $1$ unit and that $\Delta AD = \frac1{1-c} \Delta \bar{A} = \Delta Y_0$.
* The **multiplier** is the amount by which equilibrium output changes when autonomous aggregate demand increases by $1$ unit.
* We use the Greek letter $\alpha$ to denote multiplier, where $\alpha = \frac{1}{1-c}$, one can see that *the larger the marginal propensity to consume, larger the value of multiplier.* 
* Multiplier is useful is developing an explanation of fluctuations of output.
* The multiplier suggests that output changes when autonomous spending (including investment) changes and the change in output can be larger than the change in autonomous spending.
* The textbook mentions that multiplier is necessarily greater than one in a very simplified model (the model we are studying), but there do exist cases where the multiplier is less than one.
